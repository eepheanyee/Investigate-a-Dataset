# Investigate-a-Dataset
Investigating a dataset on hospital appointment and patients who don't show

In this project, I aim to investigate a dataset that collects information from over 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is mainly focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

More information about this data and the download link can be found here

I have downloaded this dataset into the project folder so I'll start by exploring the data to make sure I clean it up and get it ready for analysis.

Below are a few questions I would love to answer with my analysis
    Are there specific days of the week where patient show up is significantly higher?
    How does the neighbourhood or patient age/gender affect patient adherence to scheduled appointments?
    What factors are important to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
    Is the patient show up probability affected by the time of the day the apointment is booked for?
    Does the number of reminders sent to patient affect if they'll show up for their appointments or not?
